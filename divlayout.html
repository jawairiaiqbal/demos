		The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content in the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc). Div tag has both open(div) and closing (/div) tag and it is mandatory to close the tag. The Div is the most usable tag in web development because it helps us to separate out data in the web page and we can create a particular section for particular data or function in the web pages.
