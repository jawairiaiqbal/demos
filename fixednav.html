		All those days watching from the windows.All those years outside looking in.All that time never even knowing.Just how blind I've been.Now I'm here, blinking in the starlight.Now I'm here, suddenly I see.Standing here, it's all so clear.I'm where I'm meant to be.And at last I see the light.And it's like the fog has lifted.And at last I see the light.And it's like the sky is new.And it's warm and real and bright.And the world has somehow shifted.All at once everything looks different.Now that I see you.
